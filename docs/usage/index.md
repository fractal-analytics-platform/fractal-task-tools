The `fractal-task-tools` package includes two main features:

1. [A tool to build the manifest for a package of Fractal tasks](./manifest.md).
2. [A wrapper to run a Python task function as a standard command-line interface](./run_task.md).

> Note: these features were previously part of the [`fractal-tasks-core` package](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-tasks-core). Here is a [description of how to migrate a tasks package to `fractal-task-tools`](./legacy.md).
